# Wordle Solver Using Decision Trees
An algorithm to automatically find the word for the NYTimes Wordle. It works by building a decision tree of all possible choices for characters. It guesses taking the best combination of characters that build a valid word recognized by Wordle. The decision tree is updated with each guess, removing all other branches at the height when a green letter is found and only removing branches without any yellow letters in them, if possible.
